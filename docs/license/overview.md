Due to the different app store policies each platform (iOS, PC, Android) has it's own licensing system.
Therefore you **can't** use one license on another platform (e.g. iOS license on android).

It is possible to use one license on multiple devices of the same platform (e.g. multiple android tablets).



## Mixing Station account (PC, Android)
All licenses can be managed using your [Mixing Station account](https://dev-core.org/mixing-station/profile/licenses). If you don't have an account yet, you can [register here](https://dev-core.org/mixing-station/profile/create).

Make sure to use the same email address as used for purchasing! Otherwise we can't link the license to your account.
