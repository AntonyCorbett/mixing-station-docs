# Licenses

Due to the different app store policies each platform (iOS, Desktop, Android) has it's own licensing system.
Therefore, you **can't** use one license on another platform (e.g. an iOS license on Android).

It is possible to use one license on multiple devices of the same platform (e.g. multiple Android tablets).

## Mixing Station account (Desktop, Android)

All licenses can be managed using your [Mixing Station account](https://mixingstation.app/profile/licenses). If you
don't have an account yet, you can [register here](https://mixingstation.app/profile/create).

Make sure to use the same email address as used for purchasing otherwise we can't link the license to your account!

### Manage activations

Once you've selected a license in your mixing station account, you'll be able to see all
activations for this license.

If you switched devices, or re-installed the app multiple times you may need to disable old activations,
in order to activate the app again on your new device.
This can be done by unchecking the checkboxes in the `Active` column:

## Activation

Each license can be activated on 4 different devices at the same time.
Once the limit has been reached you can either deactivate devices you don't use anymore (
see [manage activations](#manage-activations)) or
purchase another license.

## Restore licenses

The following describes how to restore / import the license on another device.

### iOS

Make sure you're logged in with the same Apple ID as used for the initial purchase.

In case nothing happens when using the `Restore purchases` button, and you are 100% sure you're using the correct Apple
ID,
you can try pressing the `Buy` button again as it's not possible to purchase the same feature multiple times.
This might be required when switching to a new iOS device since Apple doesn't load all in app payments correctly all the
time.

### Desktop

You can restore access your licenses using your Mixing Station account or the `.lic` file.

### Android

You can restore your licenses from your Mixing Station account or the app store used for the
purchase (`Google Play`, `Amazon`, ect)
