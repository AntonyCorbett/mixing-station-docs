# PreSonus StudioLive Series 3

## Limitations

### Mutegroup assignment
Due to the way the Mutegroup assignment works, it is not possible to assign a single channel via network.
Only all currently muted channels can be "stored" as a mutegroup. Thus, this functionality is not available
in mixing station until a good alternative solution is found.

### Search on desktop
On desktop systems which also have UC installed the search may not work due to UC blocking the search port.
Either enter the IP address of the mixer manually, or fully close the UC service.
