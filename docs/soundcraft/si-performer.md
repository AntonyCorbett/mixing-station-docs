# Si Performer

The performer series has certain limitation when it comes to remote controlling.
Mixing Station currently implements all parameters which can be remote controlled. 
Any other features such as Mutegroups, FX or routing **cannot be implemented**.

## Mutegroups
It is not possible to access the mutegroups of the mixer - therefore the mute status might be shown incorrectly in the app.

## Mixer not connecting
Sometimes the network stack of the mixer crashes - this also happens with the official ipad app and is not related to mixing station.
