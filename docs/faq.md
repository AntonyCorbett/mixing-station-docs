# FAQ

## Does this app work with my mixer?
Probably, take a look at the [versions and features](feature-list.md) page.

## Will this app support mixer XYZ in the future?
Maybe. Adding support for a new mixer is a cost and time-consuming process. Due to lack of documentation for a lot
of devices, a lot of time is required to fully understand the protocol used by certain mixers and implement it accordingly.

Because of that, either a good emulator or access to the actual hardware is required. 

## License activated too many times, what should I do?
Login to your mixing station account and deactivate old, unused devices.
See [manage activations](license/overview.md#manage-activations) for more details.

## I changed devices, how to I restore my license?
The license restore process is described on [the license page](license/overview.md).

Note for Android users: If you migrated your license from the old app the only way to import it again is to import it using your Mixing Station account. You won't be able to restore it using the `Google Play` option.


## Is there a pdf version of this manual?
No, this manual contains videos/animations demonstrating certain app features, and therefore
it's not really possible to provide a pdf for it.
