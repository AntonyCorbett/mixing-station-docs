### Visible channels per layer
There are two modes on how the channels of a layer can be displayed:

#### Auto
This mode will always show all channels assigned to a layer. If required the channel strips will be resized so they fit on the screen

#### Static
The selected number of channels will be shown. If a layer has less channels, placeholders will be shown. If a layer has more channels assigned they will be hidden.
