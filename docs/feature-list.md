# Versions and features

## App versions
The app is available for two different platforms: iOS and Android. Since the app store policies are slightly different the app has different versions for each platform.

### Android
For Android the app is distributed as `Free` and `Professional` version. For each mixer there is a separate app in the app store.

### iOS
For iOS only one app is distributed. This app can control all mixers and is only available as "pro" version.
You can use all features of the app in the offline mode without paying anything. As soon as you want to connect to a mixer it's required to buy the app for the mixer model you want to connect to.
