# Connection
The mixer allows up to 16 simultaneous connections.

# RTA
As with most mixer there is only one RTA available.

In comparision to the XM32 series, the mixer will always override the RTA source if not locked.
This means that the RTA shown in the app will be different from the actual selected channel.

To properly use the RTA in the app make sure to lock the **console first**!
This behavior cannot be changed by the app.
