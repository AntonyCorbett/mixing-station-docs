# iOS

For iOS only one app is distributed. This app can control all mixers and is only available as "pro" version.
You can use all features of the app in the offline mode for free.
As soon as you want to connect to a mixer it's required to buy the app for the mixer model you want to connect to.

## Requirements
- iOS >= 9
- iPhone, iPad (project catalyst is not supported)

## URL Scheme
The URL scheme of the app is `mixingstation`. This name can be used for other app such as `BandHelper` in order to open mixing station.
