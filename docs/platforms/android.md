# Android
For Android the app is distributed as `Free` and `Professional` version. For each mixer there is a separate app in the app store.

## Requirements
- Android >= 4.0.1
- Android emulators will work for Midas/Behringer mixers, but not for A&H mixers
- Chromebooks are currently not supported

## Settings location
The app does store all settings in the internal storage of the device.

You can access all setting files at `Internal/MixingStation`
