# PC
For pc only one app is distributed. This app can control all mixers and is only available as "pro" version.
You can use all features of the app in the offline mode for free.
As soon as you want to connect to a mixer it's required to buy the app for the mixer model you want to connect to.

## Requirements
- Operating system: Windows 10 (x64), OSX 10.9 or later, Linux (arm64, x64)
- Screen: Any screen works - multi screen is only supported if they are the same size.
- Touchscreen: Multitouch is supported on windows 10 - untested on any other OS.

Please make sure the app is working in offline mode before purchasing any licenses!

## Scaling
Mixing Station tries to honor the scaling option of the OS.
If for whatever reason the UI is too large to too small you can manually adjust the scaling in the global app settings.
See [settings](../settings.md) for more details
